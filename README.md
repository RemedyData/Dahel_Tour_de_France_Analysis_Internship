## Introduction

This is an analysis of a bike racing event. It is done by analyzing data from 5 different tables namely tdf_finishers, tdf_winners, tdf_stages, tdf_tours, including an attached data dictionary. The project was carried out entirely using Microsoft Excel.
## Problem Statement

The goal of this analysis is to:

- Calculate the average speed of the riders in a specific year or across multiple years. 

- Determine which rider has won the most stages in a given year or across multiple years. 

- Calculate the time margin between the winner and other riders for each stage or overall in a race. 

- Analyze the performance of different teams by calculating the total time taken by all riders from the same team in a race. 

- Determine the birthplaces of the riders and their frequency.




## Skills and Concepts Demonstrated:

- **Microsoft Excel concepts like:**

1 Data Importing and Exporting:

- Importing data from external sources such as text files, CSV files, databases, or other Excel workbooks.
- Exporting data to different formats for sharing or further analysis.

2 Data Cleaning and Transformation:

- Removing duplicate records.
- Handling missing values (e.g., filling in missing values, deleting rows with missing data).
- Converting data types (e.g., converting text to numbers, dates).
- Splitting, merging, or rearranging data across columns.

3 Formulas and Functions:

- Utilizing built-in functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, MIN for basic calculations.
- Performing more complex calculations using functions like IF, VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, etc.
- Creating custom functions using Excel's built-in programming language, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).

4 Data Analysis Tools:

- PivotTables: Summarizing and analyzing large datasets by creating dynamic tables.
- Data Tables: Conducting what-if analysis by exploring different scenarios.
- Solver: Optimizing solutions by finding the best possible outcome based on defined constraints.

5 Statistical Analysis:

- Descriptive statistics: Calculating measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, etc.
- Correlation analysis: Determining relationships between variables using correlation coefficients.
- Regression analysis: Analyzing the relationship between dependent and independent variables.

6 Data Validation and Error Checking:

- Implementing data validation rules to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
- Using Excel's auditing tools to trace precedents and dependents, detect errors, and troubleshoot formulas.

7 Data Presentation and Reporting:

- Formatting worksheets and cells for improved readability.
- Creating dashboards and reports summarizing key insights.
- Adding data labels, titles, and annotations to charts and graphs.
- Inserting images, shapes, and text boxes to enhance presentation.

  ## Data Source:
  
The dataset for the work is gotten from Dahel Consultant Techies. It consist of 5 different tables namely tdf_finishers, tdf_winners, tdf_stages, tdf_tours, including an attached data dictionary. I studied the dataset well and its attached dictionary to gain proper insight into the dataset. You can find a link to download the dataset [here:](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16EknB8Qyovr8O27q-r8hliIonjQeFrlD?usp=drive_link)

## Data Cleaning and Transformation:

After downloading the dataset, I opened the dataset as CSV files in Microsoft Excel.
- I removed duplicate records.
- I handled missing values (e.g., filling in missing values, deleting rows with missing data).
- I converted data types (e.g., converting text to numbers, dates).
- I splitted, merged, and rearranged data across columns.

The transformation view and results are displayed below:

## Data Analysis:

- Several expressions and built-in functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, MIN and many more were made to arrive at the desired results.
- I performed more complex calculations using functions like IF, VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, etc.

## Features of the Report:
The analysis conveys information about the following key areas:

 - average speed of the riders in a specific year or across multiple years. 

- rider who has won the most stages in a given year or across multiple years. 

- time margin between the winner and other riders for each stage or overall in a race. 

- performance of different teams by calculating the total time taken by all riders from the same team in a race. 

- birthplaces of the riders and their frequency of wins.




The overall analysis of the dataset can be checked out [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10GZhJmB3JS-632sgaBUE48JR-kT92Sex/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=106022796380172080948&rtpof=true&sd=true)

## Analysis and Observation:

Summary of the insights gained into the company's performance: 

- The average speed of the riders in the year 1903 is	24.2km/hr						
								
- The Average Speed of riders across all the years is 3247.8km/hr								
								
- The Average Speed of riders for multiple years(1903,1922and1935) is 80.6km/hr

- Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil had the highest wins with the sum of wins of	32, 21, 16 respectively.

- Rider who won the most stages in a given year(1948) happens to be Gino Bartali while the rider who won the most stages across multiple year	happens to be Eddy Merckx.

- There is no correlation between Riders place and year of birth 	Frequency of Wins
